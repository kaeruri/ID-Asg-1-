# Elle's Matcha F&B Company Website

## Project Overview

This project involved designing and coding a website for Elle's Matcha, a premium F&B company with multiple branches across Singapore. The website showcases our menu, products, and allows customers to explore matcha lattes, desserts, and specialty offerings.

Elle's Matcha delivers high-quality, authentic matcha experiences with a focus on luxury and minimalism. The website enables customers to browse products, leave reviews, and sign up for member updates about café branches and new offerings.

- **Visual Identity**: Dark green primary color reflecting matcha quality, with coordinated colors, text, images, and gradients for a luxurious feel
- **Typography & Layout**: Three complementary fonts and meticulous element positioning inspired by high-end café websites
